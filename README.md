## AI usage

You are encouraged to use AI to write your assignments. We will not check if you have used AI or not. It is entirely up to you to do so. In fact, AI will probably finish your assignment within three minutes.

**However, it is also up to you to use AI in such a way that it will make you understand what is going on instead of doing everything for you while you don't understand a thing.**

## Submission
